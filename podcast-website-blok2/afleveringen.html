                <br>
                Security and freedom are closely connected. The security of elections ensures free will and the freedom to choose.
                At this point, we often think of the propaganda processes influenced by the production of fake content. Examples include...
                The problems of security and trust in politics can discourage political participation. Have we reached the end of democracy, a system that humans, as social beings, have created since the hunter-gatherer era? Will democracy become nothing more than an illusion in the face of all this technology? Or are you one of the few who refuses to stand by and let the world slip away? Then let's continue to challenge our minds: From banners to tweets.

                <br>
                Global powers may not be able to make voters ineffective, but voters choose ineffectiveness. How do we make that choice, and why do we make it?
                Before reflecting on ourselves, let's first look at the global powers. While they can't render us powerless, they can manipulate us. How?
                Echo chambers. Algorithms. How does it work?
                How do algorithms shape our decisions?

                Wilders, Trump and Timmermans? Why is this important?

                <br>
                To address a political issue, starting with two key factors: Our personal ethical values, which shape the questions we ask, and statistics.
                Can data be manipulated? Yes. Does altering data always leave a trace? Yes. In this case, can we reveal that the data has been tampered with? Yes.
                The key elements that will lead us to the most accurate statistics at the moment of decision: The comparative method, identifiable sources.
                The differences internet access and what does it mean for democracy

                <br>
                What are cookies and why should or shouldn't you accept them? What kinds of information do different websites gather and how do they use this?
                Is it possible to be more private, and if so how would this affect your social media timeline, information gathering and eventually your views?
